        "Tests failed verification - ALL tests must pass (attempt 1), re-spawning Coding Bot. 7 timeout verification tests are intentionally timing out to verify infrastructure works, but they cause test failures. Need to restructure these tests to verify timeout behavior without causing failures.",
        "Tests restructured to verify timeout infrastructure without causing actual timeouts. All 19 timeout infrastructure tests now pass, and all 398 tests in the suite pass.",
        "Documentation updated in wiki/Best-Practices.md with comprehensive test timeout guidance."
