Proposal created: Add Dictionary<int, RoomNode> to FloorGraph for O(1) lookups, update all call sites to use GetNode() instead of First(), add room dictionary to HallwayGenerator. Expected improvements: 50-90% faster BFS for 50+ nodes, 80-95% faster critical path marking, 60-85% faster hallway generation.",

Updated RoomTypeAssigner (FindPath, AssignTypes), FloorGenerator (room lookups, door placement), IncrementalSolver (all node lookups), and HallwayGenerator (room dictionary). All 411 tests pass. Ready for verification benchmarks.",
        "Verification complete. Benchmarks re-run show significant improvements: GetNodeLookups improved 25-90% (scaling with graph size), CriticalPathMarking improved 1-10% for larger graphs, CombinedOperations improved 4-9%. BFS pathfinding shows smaller improvements than expected (5% for 200 nodes vs expected 50-90%), but complexity reduction from O(n²) to O(n + m) is confirmed. Minor regressions in HallwayGenerationRoomLookups (5% slower) are within measurement variance. All 411 tests pass.",
        "Documentation complete. Added comprehensive summary section to optimization file with key results, techniques used, complexity improvements, lessons learned, and memory impact. Updated wiki/API-Reference.md with FloorGraph class documentation including GetNode() method performance notes. Updated wiki/Best-Practices.md Performance section with graph lookup performance guidance."
